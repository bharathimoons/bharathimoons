<title>An Ideal Technical documentation work flow</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1>What is technical documentation</h1>
<p>Documentation is crucial regardless of the attributes, function, or complexity of a product. It simply entails describing the features, functionality, and applications of software. For instance, instructions on how to install a piece of software from a desktop might be included in the manual. The most crucial skill set is procedural guidance on "how to," which is the key to documentation. The major responsibility of technical writers is to translate difficult technical terms into understandable English, which leads to technical documentation.</p>

<h2>What are all the steps involed</h2>
<p>There are several steps in the procedure from start to finish. The process begins when requirements are obtained for or from clients and ends when the finished product is received. The work flow of a technical documentation that is followed in a waterflow model are:
<ol style="list-style-type:number">
<li>Requirement gathering</li>
<li>Design (Planning)</li>
<li>Development or Implementation</li>
<li>Testing</li>
<li>Deployment or review</li>
<li>Maintenance/Feedback</li></p>

<p>Lets see each process separately to have a better understanding.</p>

<h3>Requirement Gatherings</h3>
<p>It can be in two ways; one is gathering requirement from the customers and the other one is prepare requirement according to the customer's requirements.</p>
<h4> Why is this required</h4>
<p>Producing a document in line with the client's specifications fosters corporate expansion, aids in maintaining long-term client connections, and distinguishes the company in the marketplace. Another technique to get over this is to create a need list that offers a variety of changes. This will please them and allow us to develop to a greater extent. Requirements are not limited to the style, format, language, audience, quality, tools, and budget.</p>

<h3>Design (Planning)</h3>
<p>Planning or estimating the project requires adequate time to ensure the quality and meeting the deadline. The required specifications from the first phase are analysed in this phase, and the system design is generated. This system design contributes to the overall system architecture, as well as the hardware and system requirements.</p>
<h3>Implementation (Development)</h3>
<p>The model, logic, and requirements developed in the previous steps are used to generate the source code. Before being implemented as a complete, the system is often planned as smaller components, or units. It could also be described as creating or developing content.</p>
<h3>Testing (Review)</h3>
<p>At this stage, any faults that need to be fixed are found through quality assurance, unit, system, and beta testing. For the aim of debugging, this can call for a forced repetition of the coding process. The waterfall process continues if the system passes the testing. It might be done more simply by reviewing the document.</p>
<h3>Maintenance (Feedback incorporation)</h3>
<p>To continuously improve, update, and enhance the finished product, corrective, adaptive, and perfective maintenance is carried out. This can entail the introduction of patch updates or new versions.</p>

<p>These are all the phases involved in document creation and it could be technical documentation pertaining to hardware domain or any other XML-based writing style.</p>
