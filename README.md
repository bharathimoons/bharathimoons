- 👋 Hi, I’m Bharathi, a technical writer with 7+ years of experience in both the hardware and software industry.
- 👀 I’m interested in upgrading my skills and to learn new technologies.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning API technical writing along with Git and Github and other authoring tools.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on learning API technical writing as having partner to learn would help in quick absorption of the concepts.
